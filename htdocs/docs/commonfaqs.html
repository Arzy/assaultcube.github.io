          Only frequently asked questions are answered on this page. If you've looked through the
          rest of the official documentation and still can't find the answer you need, you might like 
          to try <a href="http://wiki.cubers.net/ac/Special:Search">searching the wiki</a> (including 
          its <a href="http://wiki.cubers.net/action/view/FAQ">F.A.Q's</a>), and the 
          <a href="http://forum.cubers.net/search.php">forums</a>, and if you still can't find the
          answer, post a thread on the forum explaining your situation.

            What is ping/packet jump?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is covered in the interface part of the readme. Check <a href="interface.html#scoreboard">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Why do some players become transparent and salute?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is because of lag. The server has not had a response from this player for too long and so they have 
            temporarally been turned into a "ghost" that cannot be shot (but don't worry, they can't shoot you either).
          </li>
          <li>
            Someones name on the scoreboard is coloured red... why is this?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is because they are the administrator. This means they know the password to the server,
            probably because they own/run the server, or are a friend of the person who owns the server,
            and because of this, they can do what they like on THEIR SERVER. Administrators can overide 
            any votes initiated by normal players.

            I experience some motion sickness... is there any way around this?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Try increasing your <b>Field of View</b> or resolution. You can change the resolution through the <b>Quick
            setup</b> menu in settings. Field of View can be found in <b>Video settings</b> in the settings menu.

            What's a good way to get a lot of points, fast?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Try honing your skills into "<a href="basics.html#gib">gibbing</a>" your enemies instead of 
            just normal fragging. You get given 2 frags for gibbing an enemy with a knife or sniper-headshot.
            Using grenades are also a great way for gibbing more than one enemy at once.

	    I seem to get strange walls appear out of nowhere on maps with far-away areas. How do I fix this?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is a graphics glitch caused by low "minlod". In AssaultCube, type: <b>/minlod 250</b> to set minlod
            to the maximum. You might want to try a slightly lower value than 250 if you that causes too much graphics 
            lag for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Why doesn't AssaultCube have feature <i>XYZ</i> from a different game, such as Counter-Strike?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Firstly, AssaultCube is not a Counter-Strike clone! The quicker you understand this, 
            the sooner you will be able to defeat your opponents with ease.
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Secondly, just because a feature is available in your <b>favourite game A</b>, does not mean we have to implement it 
            here, it might not suit the game style that AssaultCube has... of course, that doesn't mean you can't ask for it on our
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=123597&atid=697092">feature request</a> page.
