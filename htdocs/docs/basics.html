	<h2>The basics</h2>
	<p>
	  The game objectives of AssaultCube are simple and straight-forward:
	</p>
        <ol style="margin-left : 50px;">
          <li>Find the enemy.</li>
          <li>Frag or gib the enemy.</li>
          <li>REPEAT!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are also <a href="introduction.html#flagmodes">flag-based modes</a>,
          which have other, more exciting objectives.
        </p>

          Controls
        </h4>
        <p>
          After knowing the controls, most things in AssaultCube are relatively straight forward.
          Press <b>W</b> to move forwards and then move your mouse around to change 
          directions. Left-click when aimed at an enemy to attack them.
        </p>

          You can find a list of controls used in map editing <a href="mapediting1.html#controls">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons by using the keybinding menu
          in-game.
          <br>This can be found by pressing ESCAPE and then navigating to: Settings &rArr; Input controls.

        <h4>
          Starting a single-player game
        </h4>
        <p>
          Starting a single-player game is simple. Press ESC, navigate to <b>Singleplayer</b>, then choose
          the mode, bot skill, amount of enemies and the map. Then, a game with computer-bot enemies will start immediately.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Joining a multiplayer game
        </h4>
        <p>
          Press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Join a server</i>.
          The masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers.
          This list of servers then gets saved in <i>config/servers.cfg</i> for next time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <a href="interface.html#hud">console</a> says "master server
          not replying", then that means your client failed to download the list of servers
          to play upon, and you will need to click on "<b>Force serverlist update</b>" until it updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly by using the <i>Custom connect</i> menu and
          then enter a valid IP or DNS name of a server &amp; the port number
          (and optionally a password, if the server uses one).

            <h2>
                Changing settings
            </h2>
            <p>
                Most important setting changes can actually be changed from within the menus. So,
                press <b>ESC</b> and then <b>Settings</b>. There are many important settings in
                this menu that can be changed, including changing your name and team. Look in there
                for what you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are of course other settings which can't be found inside the menu. These settings
                can be changed via the console. Check out the <a href="reference.xml">
                    reference</a> to find out about those settings and how they can be changed.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How settings are saved
            </h2>
            <p>
                There is a file called <i>defaults.cfg</i> in the <i>config</i> directory. When
                you run AssaultCube for the first time it will execute this file. Once you quit
                AssaultCube, the default settings and your changes created upon them during the
                course of the game (and settings from your autoexec.cfg) will be stored in <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
                If you want to reset your settings to default values just delete <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
                Alternatively, you can delete it using the menus, by pressing ESCAPE and going into:
                Settings â‡’ Reset all settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are commands that you would like executed every time AssaultCube starts,
                you can insert these scripting commands into <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When AssaultCube is started, it will check for the file <i>config/init.cfg</i>.
                If it does not exist then AssaultCube assumes this is the first time you have ran
                AssaultCube and will prompt you with the "quick setup" menu. This contains settings
                for you to change that are important for running AssaultCube. Such as screen resolution,
                mouse sensitivity, nickname, etc. When you press "OK", then AssaultCube will restart
                to allow those settings to take effect. The <i>config/init.cfg</i> file saves settings
                that can only be changed before AssaultCube runs, so when AssaultCube first starts,
                it will execute those settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note for linux users: Config files get saved in the hidden directory <i>.assaultcube/config</i>
                in your users home directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note for windows users: Config files get saved in a directory in your "My Documents" folder.
            </p>

                You can also select between your primary weapon, pistol/akimbo, grenade or knife
                by selecting them using the keys 1-4, or by scrolling through them with your mouse.
                Also, G will throw a grenade.

                or by typing <b>/screenshot</b>. Most players use screenshots as a way of keeping
                a record of their scores.

            <h2>
                Demos
            </h2>
            <p>
                Demos are a little bit like video recordings of the game, except what they really
		do is record all the moves made in the game so it can be replayed later (it is not
		a video file!). Demo's are recorded on THE SERVER only (as recording demos locally
		causes issues).
            </p>
            <p>
		Demo's can only be recorded if you are an <b>ADMIN</b> and have the servers admin password. 
		To record a demo, take admin and use the demo menu (Press <b>ESC</b> in-game and go to <b>Demos</b>).
		The next match, a recording will be made and you can vote to stop recording the
                demo at any time through: <i>Demos â‡’ Stop recording</i>. When the demo
                stops being recorded you will be prompted to download it by pressing <b>F10</b>
                and if pressed your demo will be downloaded.
            </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Note:</b> Some servers automatically create demos for every single game (i.e. no admin needed).
	    </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to download a previous demo that's still located on the server,
                you can use: <i>Demos â‡’ Download demos</i> in the menus. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Playing and sending custom maps
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you want to play a custom map online, then there are two things you must do...
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Firstly:</b> Start the map - This is done by voting for the map and mode to be
                played. This can be done through the menus as shown in <a href="#voting">
                    voting</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Secondly:</b> Send the map - This is done by typing <i>/sendmap</i>. 
		This will send the map file for the map stored on your computer to all the
                other players so that you can properly play the map. If the map has a config file,
                it will send that also. Note: You MUST have the map file!
            </p>
            <h2>
                Reset binds
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you would like to reset all your controls back to the defaults, you can type
                the <b>/resetbinds</b> command. Alternatively, you can find this inside <b>settings
                    â‡’ Keyboard/mouse controls</b> by choosing <b>Reset binds to default settings...</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Reset configs
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you would like to be able to reset all settings <u>AND</u> controls to default
                values, you can do this easily by typing <b>/resetcfg 1</b>. You can also do this through
                the <b>settings</b> menu by selecting <b>Reset all settings</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command will delete the saved.cfg and the init.cfg file which contains all
                the settings for AssaultCube. You will need to restart AssaultCube for this to take effect.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Console
            </h2>
            <p>
                The console shows you messages from the game at the top-left corner of your screen.
                It also displays chat from other players. If you find that the console is moving
                too fast for you and you missed an important message that you would like to read,
                you can extend the console by pressing <b>F11</b>. You can also scroll up through
                the message by pressing the minus <b>-</b> key on your keypad.
            </p>
            <p>
                More information about the console can be found <a href="interface.html#console"
                   >here</a>.
            </p>
	    <p>
		The size of the console can also be changed in the <b>Settings â‡’ Gameplay</b> menu.
	    </p>
	    <h2>
                In-game reference

                these through the menu by going through: Help â‡’ AssaultCube reference.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you know the command you would like to use, but just want some information about
                it, you can type the command into AssaultCube and information about this command
                will be displayed. You can disable this documentation reference if you want by pressing
                F1 when it is shown.
