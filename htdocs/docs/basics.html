	<p>
	  The game objectives of AssaultCube are simple and straight-forward:
	</p>
        <ol style="margin-left : 50px;">
          <li>Find the enemy.</li>
          <li>Frag or gib the enemy.</li>
          <li>REPEAT!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are also <a href="introduction.html#flagmodes">flag-based modes</a>,
          which have other, more exciting objectives.
        </p>

          Controls
        </h3>
        <p>
          After knowing the controls, most things in AssaultCube are relatively straight forward.
          Press <b>W</b> to move forwards and then move your mouse around to change 
          directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Left-click when aimed at an enemy to attack them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of all the other controls (map editing controls are <a href="mapediting1.html#controls">here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons by using the keybinding menu
          in-game.
          This can be found by pressing ESCAPE and then navigating to: Settings &#8658; Input controls.

          The masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers, like the image above.
          This list of servers then gets saved in <i>config/servers.cfg</i> for next time.
          If the <a href="interface.html#hud">console</a> says "master server
          not replying", then that means your client failed to download the list of servers
          to play upon, and you will need to click on "<b>Force serverlist update</b>" until it updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish, you can sort the server browser using your left/right keys. Press F1 in this menu
          to see other available options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly by using the <i>Custom connect</i> menu and

          Starting a single-player game is simple. Press ESC, navigate to <b>Singleplayer</b>, then choose

          Changing settings
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most important setting changes can actually be changed from within the menus. So,
          press <b>ESC</b> and then <b>Settings</b>. There are many important settings in
          this menu that can be changed, including changing your name and team. Look in there
          for what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other settings which can't be found inside the menu. These settings
          can be changed via the <a href="interface.html#console">console</a>. Check out the

          Choosing a weapon
        </h3>
        <p>
          To select a primary weapon, press B to show the weapon menu.
          Through this menu you'll be able to choose any of the five 
          <a href="introduction.html#weapons">primary weapons</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will then receive the weapon when you next respawn. 
          If you want the weapon straight away, type <span class="code">/suicide</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select between your primary weapon, pistol/akimbo, grenade or knife
          by selecting them using the keys 1-4, or by scrolling through them with your mouse.
          Pressing G or right click will throw a grenade.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Quick nade throw</b>: If you want to throw a grenade and then quickly switch
          back to your normal weapon, press and hold the right mouse button and then let go

          Talking/Chatting

        <p>
          If you want to say something to other players, it's very simple. Just press <b>T</b>
          to bring up the console where you can type whatever you would like.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to make sure what you say is said only to the players on your team (if
          in a team mode), then press <b>U</b>. This will bring up the console with a <i>%</i>
          sign in-front of it. The <i>%</i> sign is what is needed infront of <i>ANYTHING</i>
          you say to make it be seen <i>ONLY</i> by your team.

            <p>
                Voting can be used to do many various things in Multiplayer. Such as changing mode/map,
                forcing a team change, changing mastermode, kick or ban a player, setting autoteam
                and removing bans.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can make these votes through the menus in-game. When connected, press <b>ESC</b> and 
		go to <b>Set mode/map</b>.
                <br clear="none" />
                ...or by simply typing the command, i.e. <i>/ctf ac_mines</i> would start a vote

                After you get fragged, you can spectate a game simply by pressing the space bar.
                Using your mouse to scroll will change the player you are spectating. Pressing the

            <p>
                Demos are a little bit like video recordings of the game, except what they really
		do is record all the moves made in the game so it can be replayed later (it is not
		a video file!). Demo's are recorded on THE SERVER only (as recording demos locally
		causes issues).
            </p>
            <p>
		Demo's can only be recorded if you are an <b>ADMIN</b> and have the servers admin password. 
		To record a demo, take admin and use the demo menu (Press <b>ESC</b> in-game and go to <b>Demos</b>).
		The next match, a recording will be made and you can vote to stop recording the
                demo at any time through: <i>Demos ⇒ Stop recording</i>. When the demo
                stops being recorded you will be prompted to download it by pressing <b>F10</b>
                and if pressed your demo will be downloaded.
            </p>
	    <p>
		<b>Note:</b> Some servers automatically create demos for every single game (i.e. no admin needed).
	    </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to download a previous demo that's still located on the server,
                you can use: <i>Demos ⇒ Download demos</i> in the menus.

                <b>Firstly:</b> Start the map - This is done by voting for the map and mode to be
                played. This can be done through the menus as shown in <a href="#voting">
                    voting</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Secondly:</b> Send the map - This is done by typing <i>/sendmap</i>. 
		This will send the map file for the map stored on your computer to all the
                other players so that you can properly play the map. If the map has a config file,
                it will send that also. Note: You MUST have the map file!
