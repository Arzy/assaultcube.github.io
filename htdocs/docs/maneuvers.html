        <h4 id="straferunning">Strafe running</h4>
        <div>
          <img src="images/wsad-strafe.gif" style="float: right; border: 5px solid #555555; margin-left : 15px;" alt="strafe run">

        <p>
          Strafe running is the most important technique to learn, because it allows you to move about 41% faster than normal.
          This occurs because the game adds the speed you get from moving forwards or backwards, with the speed you get 
          from strafing left or right. More information can be
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafing_%28gaming%29#Straferunning">found here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strafe running is simple: While you're moving forwards (or backwards), strafe left (A) or right (D) at the same time.
          See the diagram to the right for an example.
        </p>
        <h4 id="riflejump">Rifle jump</h4>
        <div>
          <img src="images/riflejump.jpg" style="float: left; border: 3px solid #555555; margin : 15px 15px 0px 0px;" alt="rifle jump">
        </div>
        <p>
          Rifle Jumping allows you to be able to jump higher than normal. You can use this move
          to jump onto things you just couldn't normally get ontop of. Rifle jumping can even be
          used for surprising an enemy by popping up where they don't expect you to be!
        </p>
        <p>
          This move uses the recoil of the weapon you are using to push you up into the air. The assault 
          rifle is the best weapon to use with rifle jump, because it has the greatest amount of recoil, 
          where the other weapons have far less and won't be able to yield the same results as the assault rifle can.
        </p>
        <p>
          How to rifle jump: While jumping, fire your weapon at the ground while still in mid-air. You should get propelled
          further upwards and get more airtime than a normal jump would give you. See the diagram to the left.
        </p>
        <h4 id="riflesprint">Rifle sprint</h4>
        <p>
          Rifle sprintings very similar to rifle jumping. It allows you to travel at great speeds by using the
          rifles recoil in your hasty escape. It is especially useful in capture-the-flag modes or avoiding shotgun players.
        </p>
        <p>
          To rifle sprint: You MUST use the assault rifle. You will need to be careful that you are shooting away from team mates.
          When aiming, it's best to aim toward walls and slightly downward. Your back should facing the direction you wish to go. 
          Then, walk backwards and jump continuously as you fire your weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're able to, it might be best to aim your weapon at an enemy while making this move to get some frags at the same time.
        </p>
        </p>
          It should be noted however, using rifle sprint poses the following dangers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can't see or fire at any opponents that are behind your back, leaving you vulnerable.</li>
          <li>If you're playing a team-based game, your allies may think you are shooting at them (please DON'T shoot at them!)</li>
          <li>After doing this move, you may have to reload, which could be inconvenient if you are near enemies.</li>
          <li>You may run into some geometery, such as a wall, which will stop your movement and may be inconvenient.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="stallinggrenades" class="titletext" title="Also known as: Cooking off grenades">
          Stalling grenades
        </h4>
        <p>
          Grenades have a 3 second timer before they blow up. This can make it difficult to be accurate with them, however it is
          a necessary evil to ensure you don't blow yourself up in the process.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="images/item_grenade.jpg" style="float: right; border: 3px solid #555555; margin-left: 15px"
          alt="Grenades" title="screenshot starring Ronald_Reagan">
        </div>
        <p>
          However, you can become more accurate with grenades if you <i>stall</i> them. To do this, select your grenades
          as the weapon you are using, then press AND hold the fire button. Hold it for <i>nearly</i> 3 seconds, then 
          let go of the fire button to throw the grenade. If you throw it too quickly, the grenade will still have to
          wait before exploding. If you don't throw it quick enough the grenade will blow YOU up, resulting in suicide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disadvantages of stalling grenades:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While stalling the grenade for those 3 precious seconds, you're unable to fire a weapon to protect yourself.
            You may find your enemies take advantage of this to fire enough bullets into you to frag you before you release
            the grenades fury.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you hold your grenade for more than the 3 second fuse, you'll blow yourself up!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="grenadejump">Grenade jumping</h4>
        <p>
          Grenade jumping is simple, but deadly, so be careful. Because of its deadlyness, its not a very useful move.
          To grenade jump, you will need some grenades... and a lot of armour to protect you from the blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, throw a grenade at the ground and make sure you are close to it. Just before the grenade explodes
          (grenades have a 3 second timer) jump away from the grenade.
          You should be able to use the impact from the blast to jump quite high.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disadvantages of grenade jumping:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's dangerous, and could kill you.</li>
          <li>If you do survive, your depleted health may be inconvenient if you encounter an enemy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="crouchjump">Crouch jumping</h4>
        <div>
          <img src="images/teabag.jpg" style="float: right; border: 3px solid #555555; margin-left: 15px"
          title="screenshot starring Huntsman and Fate" alt="Teabag">
        </div>
        <p>
          Crouch jumping can be useful to give you <i>just</i> a little bit of extra air time during your jump, which can be helpful
          to get up onto ledges, etc. It's quite simple. After you press jump, press crouch.
        </p>
        <h4 id="teabag">Tea bagging</h4>
        <p>
          Tea bagging is a useless maneuver that has no effect at all, except that of humiliating your enemy.
          Many believe you look like an idiot for doing this move, but that's up to an individuals opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          After fragging another player, stand over that player, and repeatedly crouch up and down. The humiliating
          part of this exercise, is that you are showing no respect to them, by effectively sitting on top of their dead corpse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of how immature and stupid this exercise is, it is discouraged.
