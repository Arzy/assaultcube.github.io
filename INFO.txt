This folder contains all of the files on the main-part
of the AssaultCube website, except the following:

	Links:
	======
	./schemas
	./transformations

	Folder & Contents:
	==================
	./$_DATA_STORAGE

This folder does/will not contain (at least, for now):
	* The forum
	* The wiki
	* The masterserver

Any AssaultCube documentation should be added to ./htdocs/docs 
from now on. Upon any AC releases, simply copy/paste 
the ./htdocs/docs folder into the release. No changes necessary.

The webpage for ./$_DATA_STORAGE is partially generated by apache.
You will notice the file "DATASTORAGE_HEADER.html" in this directory.
Updating this file, will update the parts of that webpage that aren't 
automatically generated.

AC Developers:
   Before changing ANY files within these folders, PLEASE
   ensure you've asked flowtron or RandumKiwi about any possible
   issues that will occur, should you make changes to these files.

   DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE!
